RabbitMqPublishSubscribe uses a fanout queue to publish to many consumers

RabbitMQRouting uses a direct queue to publish subsets of messages to many consumers
based on a single criteria  (in this case, severity).

RabitMQTopic uses a topic queue to publish subsets of messages to many consumers
based on multiple criteria.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a queue is bound with "#" (hash) binding key - it will receive all the messages, 
regardless of the routing key - like in fanout exchange.

When special characters "*" (star) and "#" (hash) aren't used in bindings, the topic 
exchange will behave just like a direct one.
    * (star) can substitute for exactly one word.
    # (hash) can substitute for zero or more words.
