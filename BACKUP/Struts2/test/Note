XML example:
http://localhost:8080/test/User/Login.action

Annotation convention example:
http://localhost:8080/test/bank/citi

With XML the a folder with the package name contains web pages.
With annotations the package name is used only for the actions, not the web pages.


Convention Plugin

By default, the Convention plugin assumes that all of the results are stored in WEB-INF/content.

 By default, the Convention plugin will find all action classes that implement 
 com.opensymphony.xwork2.Action or whose name ends with the word Action in specific packages.
 First the Convention plugin finds packages named struts, struts2, action or actions. Any packages 
 that match those names are considered the root packages for the Convention plugin. Next, the 
 plugin looks at all of the classes in those packages as well as sub-packages and determines if 
 the classes implement com.opensymphony.xwork2.Action or if their name ends with Action (i.e. FooAction).
 
 Next, the plugin determines the URL of the resource using the class name. It first removes the word Action 
 from the end of the class name and then converts camel case names to dashes.
