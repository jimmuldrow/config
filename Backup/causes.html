<div class="mainHeading">Causes of the American Civil War</div>

<p>
Causes of the Civil War include compromises of the Constitution over slavery, control issues between 
free and slave states, slavery in the territories, the election of Lincoln and other issues. Secessionists 
made their cause explicitly clear in their pro-slavery speeches and editorials. 
</p>

<div class="header">Constitutional Compromises over Slavery</div>

<p>
The Constitution was written in 1787 and ratified in 1789. In order to get the 
ratification of Southern states, three compromises over slavery were included in 
the Constitution.
</p>

<p>
Even though slavery existed in Northern states, slavery was declining in the North,
and expanding in the South. Therefore, Southern states demanded, and got, protections 
for slavery. They included a three-fifths clause, a fugitive slave clause and a twenty 
year extension of the slave trade. The three-fifths clause gave plantation owners more 
than their share of control over the House of Representatives, even though slaves had 
neither a right to vote nor any legal rights. The fugitive slave clause was weak, and 
never enforced until the much harsher Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. The twenty year 
extension of the slave trade was ended after the twentieth year by Congress.
</p>

<p>
Both North and South believed that compromises of the Constitution over slavery implied
recognition of slavery where it existed. Therefore, it was the status of slavery in 
territories and new states that led to an impending crisis.
</p>

<div class="header">Control Issues</div>

<p>
Southern states threatened to secede if an anti-slavery President was elected. Before 1860
every President was either a Southern plantation owner or an extremely pro-slavery Northerner.
Some slave owning Presidents were anti-slavery, but Lincoln was the first Northern anti-slavery 
President to win an election.
</p>

<p>
Southerners gained control of not only the White House but also the Supreme Court, which resulted 
in the extremely pro-South Dred Scott decision.
</p>

<p>
For many years Southerners blocked legislation that would promote the growth of the anti-slavery 
North. By the 1850's the South demanded, and got, a low tariff. Pro-North legislation, including 
funds for land grant colleges, a Homestead Act, a trans-continental railroad and banking reforms 
only emerged after secession. The North made significant sacrifices in attempting to prevent secession.
</p>

<p>
To a large degree at least, the South demanded, and got, minority rule over the majority. Later attempts by the 
Northern majority to assert itself, such as the election of an anti-slavery Northern President, increased Southern 
support for secession.
</p>

<div class="header">Slavery in the Territories</div>

<p>
The Missouri Crisis of 1819 was caused by Missouri requesting admittance to the Union as a 
slave state, which would upset the balance between slave states and free states in the U.S. 
Senate. There were widespread reports of a possible war over slavery as a result. Jefferson 
said this threat was "like a fire bell in the night". 
</p>

<p>
Henry Clay, the Great Compromiser of Kentucky, worked out the Missouri Compromise of 1820 where Missouri 
would join the Union as a slave state at the same time Maine joined the Union as a free state. Also, slavery
was prohibited in Louisiana Purchase territory north of Missouri, not including Missouri.
</p>

<p>
The Mexican territory of Texas got enough United States settlers to break away from Mexico 
and form a Lone Star Republic in 1836. In 1845 Texas joined the Union as a slave state. East
Texas proved to be the natural western limit of slavery.
</p>

<p>
In 1846 plantation owner President James K. Polk engineered a war with Mexico. Texas claimed 
territory down to the Rio Grand, while Mexico claimed land up to the Nueces River. Polk sent
troops into disputed territory in a successful attempt to start a war. As a result, Polk 
conquered half of Mexico's land during the Mexican War. The land was purchased at gunpoint 
with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. Polk's aim was to win Southern territory that could be 
turned into slave states. However, there were too many mountains and deserts in territory 
conquered from Mexico for slavery to be practical. Neither North nor South realized this at 
the time.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, Northerners in Congress made many attempts to pass a Wilmot Proviso banning slavery
in territories conquered from Mexico. All of these attempts failed.
</p>

<p>
In response to threats of a war over slavery Congressman Stephen Douglas passed a series of pieces 
of legislation through Congress that, collectively, became known as the Compromises of 1850. These 
compromises admitted California to the Union as a free state, allowed popular sovereignty to decide 
the fate of slavery in Utah and New Mexico territories, banned the slave trade, but not slavery itself, 
in Washington, D.C. and allowed a harsh, new fugitive slave law. Also, the slave state of Texas was 
required to sell western land to other states.
</p>

<p>
Popular sovereignty allowed territories to vote slavery either up or down even before achieving 
statehood. Even though New Mexico and Utah passed slave codes to protect slavery, few slave owners 
chose to take slaves into those territories. In spite of popular sovereignty they later became free 
states.
</p>

<p>
The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was harsh enough to result in some Northern freemen getting kidnapped 
and forced into slavery. Many Northerners condemned what they regarded as invasions of the North 
by the "Slave Power". Northerners gathered to protest enslavement by slave catchers, and attempted 
to free some imprisoned black captives. 
</p>

<p>
In 1854 Stephen Douglas wanted to pass territorial legislation splitting Louisiana Purchase territory into
the territories of Kansas and Nebraska. Southern congressmen told Douglas they would oppose his 
territorial legislation unless it explicitly repealed the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery in 
those territories. Douglas said that to do so would cause a "hell of a storm", but did so anyway.
Conflict over the status of slavery in Bleeding Kansas led to burning, looting and a few murders. 
U.S. Senator Charles Sumner called Douglas' bill the "crime against Kansas".
</p>

<p>
At first Southerners thought Douglas was their friend, because he replaced the Missouri Compromise 
ban on slavery with popular sovereignty, which meant the majority of the inhabitants of those territories 
could vote slavery either up or down even before being admitted as states.
</p>

<p>
Since Kansas didn't have police codes protecting slavery, few slave owners chose to risk taking 
valuable "property" into Kansas territory. However, "Border Ruffians" rode from Missouri into Kansas 
with their bowie knives to vote illegally in Kansas. As a result of massive vote fraud the pro-slavery 
minority set up a pro-slavery government at Lecompton. The free-soil majority set up a rival anti-slavery 
government at Topeka.
</p>

<p>
The Lecompton government demanded that pro-slavery President Buchanan recognize their pro-slavery 
Constitution. Buchanan agreed to do so. Douglas helped defeat the Lecompton Constitution because it 
was not supported by the majority, and therefore was not allowed by his popular sovereignty doctrine.
</p>

<p>
President Buchanan said the Supreme Court would resolve the Kansas controversy. The decision that followed 
was the Supreme Court's 1857 Dred Scott decision, which held that blacks were "so far inferior, that they had no 
rights which the white man was bound to respect", that blacks had no right to citizenship, and that neither 
the Missouri Compromise nor popular sovereignty could keep slavery out of the territories.
</p>

<p>
Lincoln, during the Lincoln-Douglas debates, asked Douglas how he could defend his popular sovereignty 
doctrine against the Dred Scott decision. At Freeport, Illinois, Douglas said the free-soil majority 
could block the pro-slavery side simply by refusing to vote for the police protections that slavery required.
</p>

<p>
Because of his opposition to the Lecompton Constitution, and because of his Freeport Doctrine, Southerners 
considered Douglas to be a false friend to the South. At the same time Lincoln and many Northerners viewed 
him as having no principles for saying he didn't care if slavery was voted up or down.
</p>

<div class="header">Election of Lincoln</div>

<p>
Southern extremists such as Yancey and others worked to engineer the division of the Democratic Party into 
Northern and Southern wings because of their growing opposition to Stephen Douglas, who was increasingly
seen as a false friend of the South. They used their demand for a slave code for the territories as their 
tool for accomplishing this. Their attempt was a success. They correctly guessed that, by splitting the 
Democratic Party between North and South, the result would be the election of Abraham Lincoln, which would 
be the South's signal to secede.
</p>

<p>
Lincoln combined strong moral and political opposition to slavery with a moderate, gradual program of action.
Lincoln promised to do neither more nor less than to prevent slavery expansion into the territories, in the hope 
that doing so would put it "in the course of ultimate extinction". Most Northerners saw Lincoln as a gradualist, 
not an Abolitionist. However, Southerners saw the election of Lincoln as a sign that the pro-slavery South was 
losing control over an increasingly anti-slavery North. When the South couldn't control the majority, they wanted 
to get away from a majority they saw as a threat to slavery. The North saw threats of secession by Southern
fire eaters as mere "gasconade". They were wrong.
</p>

<p>
Lincoln's moderate anti-slavery program of action was to merely prevent the spread of slavery into new territories.
However, the destructive effects of 19th century agriculture compounded fears that slavery had to expand or end. These 
fears were felt the most in older Southern states, especially South Carolina, where the damaging effects of 19th century 
agriculture caused forty percent of the population to flee the state. Even though there were many farms back then, modern
agricultural techniques to replenish soil were unknown.
</p>

<p>
By the election of 1860 the Democratic Party was split between Northern and Southern wings. Douglas ran as a Northern 
Democrat, while Breckinridge ran as a Southern Democrat. The older Whig and American parties were replaced by the new 
Republican Party, led by Lincoln. Bell ran as a fourth candidate for President. Out of four contenders, Lincoln won a 
plurality of the popular vote, or forty percent. He also won a majority of the electoral college, and hence the election.
</p>

<p>
The six deep South states with the most slavery, plus Texas, were the first seven states to form the Confederacy immediately
after the election of Lincoln. After the Confederate government ordered General Beauregard to cannonball Fort Sumter, four 
upper South slave states with less slavery than the deep South, North Carolina, Virginia, Arkansas and Tennessee, joined 
their fellow slave states. The states with the least slavery, or border states, never seceded. The border states were 
Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Delaware and, later in the war, West Virginia. The overall pattern of secession mostly 
followed the pattern of density of slave plantations. 
</p>

<div class="header">Other Issues</div>

<p>
In 1794 inventor Eli Whitney patented the cotton gin. His gin made slavery extremely profitable.
</p>

<p>
In 1831 Nat Turner's Rebellion resulted in between 55 and 65 deaths. In retaliation Virginia killed 56 slaves. An additional
120 slaves and free blacks were killed by Southern mobs.
</p>

<p>
The tariff of 1828, revised in 1832, created a large tariff on all manufactured items imported from Europe. During the 
Lincoln Douglas debates, Douglas said the tariff issue was separate from slavery. Lincoln said the same issue was, "at 
bottom", about slavery. At the time the North wanted for Northern manufacturing to get a start, even though Northern 
manufactured products were badly made and over-priced. It was widely believed that only a high tariff would allow Northern 
manufacturing to succeed.
</p>

<p>
South Carolina politician and slave owner John C. Calhoun claimed that each state can nullify any federal law, including 
the tariff. When President Andrew Jackson heard about Southern attempts at nullification he said, "our federal Union, it 
must be preserved" and wanted nullifiers crushed. Clay worked out a compromise by which the tariff would be gradually reduced 
over a period of years. In time Northern manufacturing increased in quality and reduced in price, and the tariff was very 
significantly reduced as well.
</p>

<p>
In the 19th century the tariff took the place of an income tax. Neither North nor South wanted an income tax. A low tariff,
by the 1850s, suited the South.
</p>

<p>
By 1860 secessionists went beyond nullification to secession as their states' rights argument for defending slavery. Lincoln 
mentioned that secessionist declarations of causes for secession didn't include the Jeffersonian line about equal rights, 
the defense of which was Jefferson's right of revolution in our Declaration of Independence. Secessionists made no effort to 
separate slavery from their state's rights arguments. They wanted harsh federal action to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act 
of 1850 in combination with multiple complaints against the rights of Northern states to oppose slavery. For example, they attacked 
the Wisconsin Supreme Court's nullification of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Also, a South Carolina declaration of causes for 
secession included a list of complaints about state's rights in the North in opposition to slavery.
</p>

<p>
The slavery issue divided the three largest religious denominations, the Methodist, Baptist and Presbyterian churches, between
North and South.
</p>

<p>
Uncle Tom's Cabin was a best seller in the 1850s. Harriet Beecher Stowe's book was written to point out the un-Christian evils of 
slavery. It was popular in the North and infamous in the South.
</p>

<p>
President Pierce's administration, through an Ostend Manifesto, tried without success to add Cuba as a slave state. Also, several 
Southern states made failed attempts to restart the slave trade, or to force every free black in the South to choose a master or 
mistress.
</p>

<p>
The South viewed protection of slavery as more important than the First Amendment. Southern states pulled abolitionist pamphlets 
from the mail and burned them. The 1836 Southern Gag Rule didn't allow the right of the people to petition the Government for a 
redress of grievances, in that it blocked petitions regarding slavery.
</p>

<p>
John Brown was one of the few abolitionists who believed in violence, especially after his background in 
Kansas Territory. He and his band killed five anti-slavery people at the Pottawatomie Creek massacre in Kansas.
John Brown's raid on an armory at Harper's Ferry, Virginia in an attempt to stir up slave insurrections greatly 
increased Southern fears of such insurrections. Brown and his followers were easily captured by Virginia 
soldiers led by Robert E. Lee and hanged.
</p>

<p>
While both sides had fears of racial equality, these fears were much more extreme in the South than the North, because more than 
90 percent of blacks lived in the South, most of them as slaves.
</p>

<div class="header">Secessionists</div>

<p>
Four Confederate states, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas, wrote reasons for secession. All four of them were about 
slavery, as were many other secessionist editorials, speeches and other documents. The following exchange between Lincoln and his
former colleague, and by then Confederate Vice-President Alexander Stephens, is one example:
</p>

<p>
"You think slavery is right and should be extended; while we think slavery is wrong and ought to be restricted. That I suppose is the rub." 
<br>From Abraham Lincoln's letter to Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, Dec 22, 1860
</p>

<p>
"We at the South do think African slavery, as it exists with us, both morally and politically right. This opinion is founded upon the 
inferiority of the black race. You, however, and perhaps a majority of the North, think it wrong." 
<br>From Stephens' reply to Lincoln, Dec 30, 1860
</p>

<div class="header">Lost Cause Mythology</div>
<p>
After Confederate defeat there was no slavery to defend, and slavery was reviled throughout the world.
Southerners, led by Jefferson Davis and Alexander Stephens, claimed that slavery wasn't really the cause
of the war. Davis also denied personal blame for causing the war, even though he ordered the attack on Fort Sumter.
These arguments were part of Southern attempts to glorify the lost cause of the Confederacy.
</p>

<p>
However, before the war Davis led the Southern fight for slavery in the territories, and Stephens said that slavery was the 
"corner stone" of the Confederacy.
</p>

<div class="header">Modern Opinions</div>
<p>
In July 2015, a McClatchy-Marist poll asked "Was slavery the main reason for the Civil War, or not?" 53 percent correctly said it was, 
while 41 percent said it was not.
</p>

<p>
Also in 2015, the Texas State Board of Education required that State of Texas history books make no mention of the Klan or segregation.
Patricia Hardy, a Republican board member, said that "Slavery came about as a side issue to the Civil War. It's not the reason for the 
Civil War. It's not slavery". The Board of Education required that the role of slavery be minimized in Texas history books. Historians 
say that slavery was the cause of secession, as did secessionists themselves.
</p>

<p>
For example, the Texas Declaration of Causes mentions the following cause:<br>
"In all the non-slave-holding States, in violation of that good faith and comity which should exist between entirely distinct nations, 
the people have formed themselves into a great sectional party, now strong enough in numbers to control the affairs of each of those 
States, based upon an unnatural feeling of hostility to these Southern States and their beneficent and patriarchal system of African slavery, 
proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color-- a doctrine at war with nature, in opposition to the 
experience of mankind, and in violation of the plainest revelations of Divine Law. They demand the abolition of negro slavery throughout the 
confederacy, the recognition of political equality between the white and negro races, and avow their determination to press on their crusade 
against us, so long as a negro slave remains in these States".
